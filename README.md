# 🖥️ Prathvish Shetty — Terminal-Style Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my terminal-style developer portfolio 🖥️ — built to look and behave like a real terminal environment 🧑‍💻.

😅 Bored of the same old scrolling portfolio websites, I decided to try something different. This CLI-inspired interface showcases my:

✨ Projects  
🛠️ Skills  
💼 Experience  
🏆 Achievements  

…all through realistic command-line interactions ⚡

Everything’s interactive, keyboard-driven, and styled like a developer’s daily workspace — because that’s where we spend most of our time ⌨️.
